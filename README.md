# BUILDING A REAL-TIME ANOMALY DETECTION SYSTEM 
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I started this project to solve the problem of detecting abnormalities in sales, the dataset used for this project was the walmart sales dataset. In order to enable a precise anomaly detection in the sales dataset, 
I have employed accurate data pre-processing technique and utilized k-means clustering machine learning algorithm which elucidate hidden patterns, outliers, and abnormalities in the sales data. 
I was successful in creating a dependable system that work well with current sales operations and offer a real-time anomaly detection for pro-active decision support. This will enable businesses to operate more swiftly, streamline their sales processes, and increase their overall sales success.
## KEY FEATURES:
1. K-means Clustering Algorithm: This project harnesses the capacity of the K-means clustering algorithm to identify patterns and anomalies.  By grouping related data points into clusters, we are able to identify outliers and anomalous behaviour that may call for further investigation.
2. Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering: Prior to use, the dataset is carefully processed. While feature engineering is done to assure reliable results. This helps to improve the effectiveness of the anomaly detection process, which involves handling missing values, scaling features, and choosing useful attributes.
3. Data Visualization: it is essential to visualise the anomalies that have been found. In order to help users better comprehend the sales patterns, this project provides interactive data visualisation that facilitates a deeper understanding of the sales pattern.
4. Real-time Anomaly Detection: The system is built to handle streams of real-time sales data efficiently while continuously checking for anomalies as fresh data is received.
## START GUIDE
* clone this resipotory:  git clone https://github.com/pojakovo/Anomaly-detection.git
* Requirements: Ensure that R and Rstudio are installed on your system, If you haven't installed it yet, you can download and install it from their official website
* R: https://www.r-project.org/
* RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/ 
* Run the installer and follow the prompts then click the desktop icon to initialize RStudio 
* Install required libraries and packages: you can install the required packages by running the command in the RStudio console
* open the project in Rstudio: go to file then open project in the toolbar then navigate to the project folder that you cloned from the repository, select the project folder and click open.
* Run the analysis: once the project is open in RStudio, locate the main R script that contains the anomaly detection code double click on the file to open it in the code editor then execute the code by clicking on the run button.
* configure the necessary parameters and settings for the anomaly detection process within the script 
* Run the script to perform anomaly detection analysis
