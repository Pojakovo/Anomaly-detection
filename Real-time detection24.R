# Real-time Anomaly detection

# Load required packages and libraries

# Load in the trained saved model
model <- readRDS("kmeans_model.AnomalyDetection") # replace with the actual path to which you have saved your model

# load in new data (replace this with your own data)
new_data <- read.csv("path/to/new/data.csv") # the actual path to your new data
# pre-process the new data. such as cleaning, handing missing values scaling and other preprocess step in the oriinal data


preprocessed_new_data <- preprocess(new_data)  # Replace "preprocess" with your actual preprocessing steps


# Apply the trained k-means model to preprocessed new data to detect anomalies 
predictions <- predict(model,preprocessed_new_data)

# View the predicted cluster assignments
print(predictions)
